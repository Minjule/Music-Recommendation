# Music-Recommendation
just wanted to try this kind of project おねがいします。

Used Free Music Archive(FMA) dataset from International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR),2017. FMA: A Dataset For Music Analysis which provides all metadata and features for all tracks has mp3 type of musics of 161 genres. I used relatively smaller version(fma_small) of it. 
Here is the paper for this dataset if you want. -> https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01840
Aaaaand a repo -> https://github.com/mdeff/fma
